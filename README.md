# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-with-Database
This repository contains the implementation of machine learning algorithms being trained and tested on the loan approval dataset, also available in this repository. The model used in this project is Random Forest Classifier, as it achieved the highest training and testing accuracy scores of 98% and 82.5% respectively. 
The front end of this project is developed using Streamlit.
Data entered in the Streamlit form is stored in a database, which is created by the driver code (Bank_Loan_Prediction.py).
